# Cloudflare Pages Deployment Integration Plan

## Overview
Enable users to share their AI-generated linktree projects via permanent, publicly accessible URLs using Cloudflare Pages deployment.

---

## PHASE 0: Prerequisites & Setup (Priority: CRITICAL) ✅

### 0.1 Human-in-the-Loop Tasks
- [x] **Create Cloudflare Account** (Manual)
  - Go to https://cloudflare.com and sign up
  - Verify email address
  - Note your Account ID from dashboard
- [x] **Generate API Token** (Manual)
  - Go to My Profile → API Tokens
  - Click "Create Token"
  - Select "Custom Token" → Get started
  - Name: "Manit Deployment Token"
  - Permissions: Account → Cloudflare Pages → Edit
  - Copy and save the token securely
- [x] **Add Environment Variables** (Manual)
  - Added to `.env`:
    - `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=your_account_id`
    - `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=your_api_token`
    - `CLOUDFLARE_PROJECT_PREFIX=manit` (for project naming)

### 0.2 Deployment Strategy Decision
- [x] **Choose URL Structure**:
  - Option A: One CF project per user project (Recommended)
    - Pros: Clean URLs, isolated deployments, easy cleanup
    - Cons: More projects to manage
    - URL format: `{projectname}-{randomid}.pages.dev`
  - Option B: Single CF project with deployments
    - Pros: Simpler management
    - Cons: Complex URL structure, harder to track
    - URL format: `manit.pages.dev/{deploymentid}`
  - **Decision**: Using Option A for better user experience

## Technical Decisions

### Architecture Choices:
- **Wrangler CLI over REST API**: More reliable for file uploads
- **Temp directory approach**: Simpler than streaming files
- **One project per deployment**: Better URL structure
- **Async deployment**: Don't block UI during deployment

### Implementation Notes:
- Keep E2B sandbox as immediate preview
- Deploy to Cloudflare in background
- Store both URLs for redundancy
- Progressive enhancement approach

### Risk Mitigation:
- **Rate limits**: Implement queuing and backoff
- **File size limits**: Validate before deployment
- **API failures**: Comprehensive error handling
- **Cost overruns**: Usage monitoring and limits

## Questions for Product Decisions

1. **Deployment Timing**: Should we deploy immediately after generation or add a "Deploy" button?
2. **URL Customization**: Should users be able to customize their subdomain?
3. **Project Lifecycle**: How long should deployments persist? Forever or with expiration?
4. **Access Control**: Should deployed sites be public or have optional password protection?
5. **Analytics**: Should we track visits to deployed sites?

---

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Action**: Create Cloudflare account and get API credentials
2. **First Implementation**: Build core deployment service with Wrangler
3. **Testing**: Deploy a few test projects manually to validate approach
4. **Integration**: Connect to existing Inngest workflow
5. **Polish**: Add UI improvements and error handling
