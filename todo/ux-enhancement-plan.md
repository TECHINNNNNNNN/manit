## Implementation Notes

### Quick Wins (Can do today):
- Button loading states âœ…
- Form opacity during submission âœ…
- Basic skeleton screens
- Error message improvements

### Technical Considerations:
- **Skeleton screens**: Use CSS animations for performance

- **Animations**: Use CSS transforms for 60fps
- **Mobile**: Test on real devices, not just browser

### Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Test on slow 3G connection
- [ ] Test with CPU throttling
- [ ] Test on various screen sizes
- [ ] Test with keyboard only
- [ ] Test with screen reader
- [ ] Test error scenarios

### Metrics to Track:
- Time to Interactive (TTI)
- First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- User engagement metrics
- Error rates
- Form completion rates
